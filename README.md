## PragmataPro

I don't know if in the future my font [PragmataPro](https://www.fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/)â„¢ will be open source (I hope)

while you visit its web page for more informations and updates 

and keep me informed about issues you found and suggestions to improve it

Many thanks!
Fabrizio Schiavi
